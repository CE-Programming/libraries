 * Opens a varaible given then name and flags

 * Otherwise it returns the available slot number (1-5)
 * Available modes:
 * "r"  - Opens a file for reading. The file must exist. Keeps file in archive if in archive.                                   (Archive)
 * "w"  - Creates an empty file for writing. Overwrites file if already exists.                                                 (RAM)
 * "a"  - Appends to a file. Writing operations, append data at the end of the file. The file is created if it does not exist.  (RAM)
 * "r+" - Opens a file to update both reading and writing. The file must exist. Moves file from archive to RAM if in archive.   (RAM)
 * "w+" - Creates an empty file for both reading and writing. Overwrites file if already exists.                                (RAM)
 * "a+" - Opens a file for reading and appending. Moves file from archive to RAM if in archive. Created if it does not exist.   (RAM)
 * Unlike the standard implementation of fopen, the "b" (binary) mode is not available because characters are only 8 bits wide on this platform.
