# User Installation
Simply send the libraries in the root directory of the zip file to your calculator using TI Connect CE or TILP.

See below for the download link.

# Developer Installation

*Note to developers:* Because of versioning for these libraries, it is highly recommended you do not include these libraries with your programs. You can simply link the release in so that way users have an ability to download the latest version: https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest


You can simply `#include <lib/ce/libname.h>` to use the library's functions within your program.
